# TorsionBar

Model in which two rotational inertias (two circular masses) are linked via a flexible rotational springdamper (a flexible rod). One of the masses is actuated by a motor, and the other mass is controlled by a predefined setpoint. By steering the motor on the one mass, the other mass (on the other side of the springdamper) thus has to be controlled.
