Model Description:
ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS_EXAMPLES.FMI_Rectifier_Example.partition1.exp1
Three-phase rectifier with resistive load. Provides continuous voltage from a three-phase voltage input. It works at a 50 Hz frequency and
an input phase voltage of 220 VRMS. The output voltage thus has a maximum value of 20*sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) = 539 V. The rectifier is made of
six diodes which are polarized based on the three input voltages, guaranteeing a positive output voltage.
